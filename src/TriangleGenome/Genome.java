package TriangleGenome;

/**
 * This class represents a genome (DNA).
 * The genome contains 200 triangles and
 * each triangle contains 10 genes for a total
 * of 2000 genes making up a genome. Since the
 * genome represents a combination of triangles
 * (and thus genes) it can be compared to the
 * original image implying each Genome has a fitness.
